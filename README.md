# AIS Spoofing Detector

A lightweight Bash tool designed to detect anomalous or spoofed AIS (Automatic Identification System) data in maritime traffic logs.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview

This tool continuously monitors AIS logs for signs of data spoofing such as:

- **Excessive vessel speed** beyond typical maritime thresholds
- **Invalid geographic coordinates** (e.g. 0,0 or out-of-range lat/lon values)

It generates an alert log for potential spoofing events and is adaptable to various vessel types and formats. This project demonstrates practical application of **detection engineering**, **log analysis**, and **Bash scripting** in a maritime context.
